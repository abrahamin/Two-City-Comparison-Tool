# Two-City-Comparison-Tool

## Description

Two-City-Comparison-Tool is a front-end application that allows the user to compare two cities of their choosing by accessing data related to maps, weather, Covid-19, and jobs. These points of reference were made possible by using the Google Maps, CovidActNow, and OpenWeather APIs.

## User Story

```
AS A software developer looking for a job in various cities,
I WANT to be able to compare data of two cities on one website
SO THAT I can make an educated decision regarding my job search.
```

## Features

```
GIVEN a comparison tool with two city inputs and checkboxes for select data
WHEN I specify certain cities and checkboxes and click submit
THEN I am presented with data that corresponds to the input
WHEN I type into the input field
THEN I am shown recommended city searches
WHEN no checkboxes are clicked
THEN a modal is displayed on the screen prompting the user to select one or more checkboxes
WHEN I search while the Map checkbox is clicked
THEN I am presented with an interactive map of the city with a pin at the center
WHEN I search while the COVID checkbox is clicked
THEN I am shown the county, case count, deaths, ICU capacity ratio, positive test ratio, and case density
WHEN I search while the Jobs checkbox is clicked
THEN I am presented with multiple job openings at certain companies with varying languages and pay
WHEN I search while the Weather checkbox is clicked,
THEN I am presented with current weather conditions, min/max temperature, humidity, and wind speed
WHEN the COVID and Job data is not available for the specified city,
THEN an error message is shown on the screen
WHEN I leave a input field blank after the initial search
THEN I continue to see the last searched city data on the page
```
